Evolution to [vinculum-liber](http://github.com/mzdv/vinculum-liber)

Goal is to allow logging and representation in near-real time of web application telemetry data.

THIS IS ALL VERY EXPERIMENTAL
=============================

Goal is to have a solution that can be integrated with Azure and their monitoring API for additional telemetry,
that can provide us with a near-realtime insight into the status of our webapp. Furthermore, all data is logged
into a MongoDB database, so it can be datamined later.
